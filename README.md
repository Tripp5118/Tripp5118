- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tripp5118
- 👀 I’m interested in Blazor Web Development, Building Keyboards, and Sleeping
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blazor Web Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much right now, am busy at an internship.
- 📫 How to reach me: Message me on GitHub, assuming that's a thing. I'm not about to post personal contact info online.

I'm just going to use the default template for this ReadMe. I'm on break right now and I'd rather spend my time snacking.
